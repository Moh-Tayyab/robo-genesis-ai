# Character Development Skill: Crafting Compelling Personalities

## Overview
The Character Development Skill provides a structured approach to creating rich, multi-dimensional characters essential for any compelling narrative. It delves into the core aspects of a character's being, from their origins to their emotional journeys, ensuring they resonate with the audience.

## When to Employ This Skill
This skill is invaluable in situations such as:
*   User requests to "Create a protagonist for my fantasy novel."
*   User asks to "Develop character arcs for my main cast."
*   When a new character needs a detailed profile to guide their role in the story.

## How This Skill Operates
The character development process is initiated and structured as follows:

1.  **Role Definition**: The skill will first query the user to specify the character's primary role within the narrative (e.g., Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting Character).
2.  **Profile Generation**: A comprehensive character profile will be generated, encompassing:
    *   **Identity**: Name and age.
    *   **Core Concept**: A concise, one-line "hook" that captures their essence.
    *   **Backstory**: Three pivotal bullet points detailing their past experiences and significant life events.
    *   **Motivation**: The primary driving force behind their actions and decisions.
    *   **Emotional Arc**: A clear outline of their emotional journey from beginning to end (e.g., "naive idealist → disillusioned realist → hopeful leader").
    *   **Flaws and Growth**: Identification of key character flaws and potential moments of personal growth.
3.  **Scene Suggestions**: Three distinct scene concepts will be proposed, specifically designed to reveal critical aspects of the character's personality, motivations, or arc in a dynamic way.

## Output Format
The character profile will be presented in a clear, easy-to-digest Markdown format:

*   **Name**: [Character's Name]
*   **Age**: [Character's Age]
*   **Hook**: [One-line description/essence of the character]

### Background & Psychology
*   **Backstory**:
    *   [Key historical event 1]
    *   [Key historical event 2]
    *   [Key historical event 3]
*   **Primary Motivation**: [What drives the character]
*   **Emotional Arc**: [Starting state] → [Transformative change] → [Ending state]
*   **Key Flaws**: [List of significant character weaknesses]
*   **Growth Moments**: [Potential pivotal points for character development]

### Narrative Integration
*   **Suggested Revealing Scenes**:
    1.  [Scene idea 1: How it reveals character aspect]
    2.  [Scene idea 2: How it reveals character aspect]
    3.  [Scene idea 3: How it reveals character aspect]

## Example Interaction
**User Input**: "Create a protagonist for a dark fantasy novel, a reluctant hero who discovers they have magical abilities."  
**Expected Output**: A detailed character profile including their name, age, hook, backstory, motivation, emotional arc, flaws, growth moments, and three specific scene suggestions that highlight their journey.
