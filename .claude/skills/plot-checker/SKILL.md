# Plot Consistency Skill: Ensuring Narrative Cohesion

## Overview
The Plot Consistency Skill is a critical tool for authors and storytellers, designed to identify and rectify narrative inconsistencies that can undermine a story's credibility. It performs a rigorous analysis of plot elements, timelines, and character actions to ensure a seamless and believable narrative.

## When to Employ This Skill
This skill is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
*   User provides an outline or chapter drafts and requests: "Check my plot for inconsistencies."
*   User asks: "Find any contradictions in my story timeline."
*   During the revision phase when ensuring narrative integrity is paramount.

## How This Skill Operates
The plot consistency check follows a systematic diagnostic process:

1.  **Comprehensive Scan**: The skill performs an in-depth scan of the provided outline or chapter drafts, parsing narrative events and character developments.
2.  **Timeline Validation**: It rigorously validates the chronological flow, scrutinizing dates, character ages, and event sequences to identify any anachronisms or temporal discrepancies.
3.  **Contradiction Flagging**: Identifies and flags instances where character actions, established facts, or plot developments contradict earlier narrative elements (e.g., a character exhibiting knowledge they shouldn't possess at a given point, or an event occurring that negates a previous one).
4.  **Problem Diagnosis & Solution Suggestion**: For each identified issue, the skill not only highlights the problem but also proposes practical fixes and concise rewrite suggestions to resolve confusing or contradictory sections.

## Output Format
The results of the plot consistency check will be presented as a clear, actionable report:

*   **Summary of Issues**: A numbered list of all identified inconsistencies.
*   **Detailed Issue Breakdown**: For each detected problem:
    *   **Location**: Precise reference to where the inconsistency occurs within the text (e.g., "Chapter 3, Paragraph 2" or "Character X's dialogue in Scene Y").
    *   **Problem Description**: A clear explanation of why the identified element constitutes a contradiction or inconsistency.
    *   **Suggested Fix**: A proposed solution or short rewrite to rectify the issue, aimed at enhancing narrative logic and coherence.

## Example Interaction
**User Input**: "Here's my outline for a mystery novel. Check for any plot holes or timeline issues."  
**Expected Output**: A report detailing any identified contradictions in character actions, timeline discrepancies, or logical inconsistencies within the provided mystery novel outline, along with concrete suggestions for resolution.
