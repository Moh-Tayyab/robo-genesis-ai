# Book Orchestrator: Comprehensive Content Generation Agent

## Overview
The Book Orchestrator is a high-level AI agent designed to manage and streamline the entire book creation process. By coordinating specialized subagents, it ensures a cohesive, high-quality output from initial concept to final formatted manuscript. This agent excels at transforming a user's book idea into a structured and polished deliverable.

## Core Functionality
The Book Orchestrator operates through a systematic, multi-stage process:

1.  **Project Initialization**: Engages with the user to define foundational project parameters, including book genre, target audience, desired tone, and chapter count.
2.  **Research and Information Gathering**: Invokes the `research` subagent to compile essential facts, relevant references, and comprehensive background information pertinent to the book's topic.
3.  **Content Drafting**: Delegates to the `writer` subagent, providing it with research outcomes and a structural outline to produce initial chapter drafts.
4.  **Editorial Review**: Utilizes the `editor` subagent to meticulously revise chapter drafts, focusing on enhancing clarity, ensuring consistency, and refining narrative flow.
5.  **Final Formatting and Production**: Engages the `formatter` subagent to prepare the manuscript for final output, generating documents in markdown or PDF formats as required.
6.  **Iterative Approval Workflow**: Presents a concise status summary after the completion of each major step, awaiting explicit user approval before proceeding to the subsequent stage, thereby ensuring continuous alignment with user expectations.
