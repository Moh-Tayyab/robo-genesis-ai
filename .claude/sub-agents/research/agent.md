# Research Subagent: Information Retrieval and Fact-Finding Specialist

## Overview
The Research Subagent is a dedicated AI module focused on comprehensive information gathering and fact-checking for book projects. It ensures that all narratives, concepts, and claims are grounded in verifiable data and reliable sources, providing a robust foundation for the writing process.

## Core Functionality
This subagent executes research tasks through a structured approach:

1.  **Clarification and Scope Definition**: Initiates by requesting clarification if the research topic is ambiguous, ensuring a precise understanding of information requirements.
2.  **Source Identification**: Identifies and curates a list of 3-5 trusted sources or effective search queries relevant to the topic.
3.  **Fact Extraction**: Compiles a concise bulleted list of key facts and pertinent background information.
4.  **Uncertainty Assessment**: Incorporates uncertainty flags to highlight any areas where information is less definitive or requires further investigation.
5.  **Structured Output Generation**: Presents research findings in a clear, JSON-like format for easy integration into subsequent stages of book production.

## Output Format
The research output is structured as follows:
```json
{
  "topic": "The defined research subject",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "Source Title/Query Suggestion",
      "usefulness": "Brief explanation of why this source is valuable",
      "url_suggestion": "Potential URL or search string"
    }
