## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## Content Creation Rules

When writing lessons for this curriculum:

1. **Always reference this file AND project-index.md** before writing any content
2. **Check the layer** - don't introduce L3 concepts in L1 lessons
3. **Respect prerequisites** - Part 2 assumes Part 1 knowledge
4. **Use "Try With AI" pattern** for all lessons (see constitution)
5. **Hardware awareness** - warn when content requires specific hardware
6. **Safety first** - all robot examples are simulation-first
7. **Follow folder structure** - use exact folder names from project-index.md
