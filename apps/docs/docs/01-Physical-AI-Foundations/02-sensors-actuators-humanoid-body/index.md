# Chapter 2: Sensors, Actuators & The Humanoid Body Plan

Welcome to Chapter 2! In this chapter, you'll explore the fundamental hardware that makes physical AI possible. Just as your brain needs eyes, ears, and muscles to interact with the world, robots need **sensors** to perceive their environment and **actuators** to move and act.

## What You'll Learn

This chapter bridges the gap between abstract AI concepts and physical reality. You'll discover:

1. **How robots sense the world** - LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, and force sensors
2. **How robots move** - Electric motors, hydraulics, and degrees of freedom
3. **Why humanoid form matters** - The design principles behind human-shaped robots

## Chapter Structure

### Lesson 1: Robot Sensors - The Five Senses of Physical AI
Explore the sensory systems that allow robots to perceive their environment, from laser-based distance measurement to depth-sensing cameras.

### Lesson 2: Actuators and Motors - How Robots Move
Understand the mechanical systems that convert electrical signals into physical motion, and why choosing the right actuator matters.

### Lesson 3: The Humanoid Body Plan
Examine why engineers design robots with human-like bodies, and how joint placement affects capability and balance.

### Lab: Sensor Matching Exercise
Apply your knowledge by matching sensors to real-world tasks and designing a robot for a specific challenge.

## Why This Matters

Before you can program a robot's behavior or train AI models, you need to understand the physical constraints and capabilities of the hardware. A robot can only be as intelligent as its sensors are informative, and can only execute plans that its actuators can physically perform.

Think of this chapter as learning the "vocabulary" of robot bodies—the building blocks you'll orchestrate with software in later chapters.
