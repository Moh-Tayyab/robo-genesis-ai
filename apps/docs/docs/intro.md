# AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook** — a comprehensive, hands-on guide to building intelligent robotic systems using modern AI-first approaches.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook takes you on a journey from foundational robotics concepts to advanced AI-powered humanoid systems. You'll learn:

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Master the Robot Operating System 2 for building modular, scalable robot applications
- **Simulation Environments**: Work with Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim for realistic robot testing
- **AI Integration**: Incorporate machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing into robotic systems
- **Physical AI**: Understand embodied intelligence and how AI agents interact with the physical world
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Design, simulate, and control humanoid robots with advanced motion planning

## Learning Approach

This textbook follows a **layered pedagogical approach**:

1. **Manual Layer (L1)**: Build foundational understanding through hands-on exercises
2. **Collaboration Layer (L2)**: Learn to work effectively with AI coding assistants
3. **Intelligence Layer (L3)**: Create reusable patterns, templates, and automation
4. **Spec-Driven Layer (L4)**: Master system-level design and architecture
