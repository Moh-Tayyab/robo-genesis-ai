# Chapter 1: What Is Physical AI? The Rise of Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the beginning of your journey into Physical AI—where artificial intelligence meets the real world.

## What You'll Learn

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts that distinguish Physical AI from traditional digital AI systems. You'll explore why embodied intelligence requires different approaches, constraints, and design principles than AI systems that exist purely in digital spaces.

## Chapter Overview

### Lesson 1: Digital AI vs Physical AI
Discover the key differences between AI systems that operate in virtual environments and those that must navigate the physical world. You'll understand why a chatbot and a walking robot require fundamentally different architectures.

### Lesson 2: The Embodiment Hypothesis
Explore how having a physical body shapes intelligence itself. Learn why physical interaction with the world isn't just about executing actions—it's about how intelligence develops and learns.

### Lesson 3: Real-World Constraints
Investigate the practical limitations that Physical AI systems face: latency requirements, power budgets, safety considerations, and the unpredictability of real environments.

### Lab: Integrating Concepts
Apply what you've learned through hands-on exercises that use AI assistance to deepen your understanding of Physical AI fundamentals.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter:
- Basic understanding of artificial intelligence concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming (no coding in this chapter, but helpful for context)
- Curiosity about how robots work in the real world

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the key differences between digital AI and Physical AI
- Describe the embodiment hypothesis and its implications for robot design
- Identify the major constraints that Physical AI systems must respect
- Evaluate real-world scenarios from a Physical AI perspective
