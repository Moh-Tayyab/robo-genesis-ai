### Exercise 4.1: Humanoid vs. Alternative Designs

For the airport assistant robot scenario above, compare your humanoid design to two alternatives:

#### Alternative 1: Wheeled Robot (like airport cart)

**Advantages over humanoid:**
1.
2.
3.

**Disadvantages vs. humanoid:**
1.
2.
3.

2.
3.

**Disadvantages vs. humanoid:**

2.
3.

---

**Final Recommendation:**
Which design (humanoid, wheeled, or quadruped) would you recommend for the airport assistant role? Why?

---

## Part 5: Reflection and Discussion

### Critical Thinking Questions

1. **Sensor Redundancy:**
   In your airport robot design, which sensors should have backups in case of failure? How would you detect sensor malfunction?

2. **Graceful Degradation:**
   If the robot's depth camera fails, how can it continue operating safely using remaining sensors? What functionality would be lost?

3. **Real-World Constraints:**
   Airport terminals have strict safety regulations. What certifications or safety features would your robot need before deployment? How might this affect your design choices?

4. **Ethical Considerations:**
   Some travelers may be uncomfortable with humanoid robots. How could your design address this? Would a less human-like appearance be better?

## Try With AI

Now let's use AI to validate and extend your designs.

### Initial Request

> "I designed a humanoid robot for airport passenger assistance with the following specifications: [paste your design from Part 3]. Review this design and identify: (1) potential safety issues, (2) component cost estimates, (3) any missing sensors or actuators, (4) possible failure modes. Provide specific recommendations for improvements."

### Critical Evaluation

After receiving the AI's response, check:

- [ ] Did the AI identify realistic safety concerns you missed?
- [ ] Are the cost estimates reasonable (compare to commercial robots if possible)?
- [ ] Does the AI suggest any sensors you hadn't considered?
- [ ] Are the failure modes plausible and serious?

### Focused Update

> "The airport wants the robot to also assist passengers with disabilities (wheelchair users, visually impaired, hearing impaired). How should the design change to accommodate these requirements? Focus on sensors, interface design, and safety features."

### Second Iteration

> "Compare my design to real airport robots like LG's CLOi GuideBot or SoftBank's Pepper (used in some airports). What design decisions did they make differently? Which approach is better for the airport assistant task?"

### Reflection

1. What design flaws did the AI identify that you missed? Why do you think you overlooked them?
2. Did adding accessibility requirements significantly change the design? Which changes were most important?
3. After learning about real airport robots, would you change your humanoid/wheeled/quadruped recommendation? Why or why not?
