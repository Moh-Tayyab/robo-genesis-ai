- Are there any design choices you find particularly interesting?

#### 5. Current Status
- Is this a research prototype, commercial product, or somewhere in between?
- Who can access or purchase it?
- What stage of development is it in?

### Deliverable

Create a 1-2 page document or slide deck presenting your findings. Include:
- Specification table
- Key images (credited appropriately)
- Analysis of design trade-offs
- Your assessment of its strengths and limitations
- Comparison to one of the four platforms from Lesson 2

## Lab Exercise 2: Application-Specific Platform Recommendation

### Scenario

You've been hired as a consultant to recommend a humanoid robot platform for one of the following organizations:

**Scenario A - Hospital Environment**:
- Need: Robot to transport meals, medications, and supplies throughout a hospital
- Environment: Smooth floors, elevators, automatic doors, but also crowded hallways
- Constraints: Must operate safely near patients, medical staff, and visitors
- Budget: $50,000-$150,000 per unit

**Scenario B - Warehouse Logistics**:
- Need: Robot to pick items from shelves and place in bins for shipping
- Environment: Structured warehouse with standardized shelving
- Constraints: Must work 8-hour shifts, handle packages up to 20 kg
- Budget: $30,000-$100,000 per unit, planning to deploy 10 units

**Scenario C - Assisted Living Facility**:
- Need: Robot to help elderly residents with daily tasks (fetching items, reminders, light cleaning)
- Environment: Residential setting with furniture, carpets, stairs
- Constraints: Must be safe and non-threatening, simple for residents to interact with
- Budget: $20,000-$60,000 per unit

### Task

1. **Choose one scenario** to focus on
2. **Analyze requirements** specific to that scenario:
   - What capabilities are essential?
   - What capabilities are nice-to-have?
   - What safety constraints must be met?
   - What reliability level is required?

3. **Recommend a platform** from those you've studied (including Exercise 1)
   - Justify your choice based on technical capabilities
   - Address any gaps between robot capabilities and requirements
   - Discuss risks or limitations
   - Propose mitigations for those limitations

4. **Alternative consideration**: What would you recommend if your first-choice platform wasn't available or proved unsuitable?

### Deliverable

Write a 2-3 page recommendation memo that includes:
- Executive summary (your recommendation in 3-4 sentences)
- Requirements analysis
- Platform comparison (comparing 2-3 options)
- Final recommendation with justification
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Lab Exercise 3: Future Capabilities Speculation

### Task

Based on your understanding of current challenges and emerging technologies, make informed predictions about humanoid robot capabilities in 5, 10, and 20 years.

### Framework

For each time horizon, predict:

#### 5 Years (2029)
Focus on **incremental improvements** to existing capabilities:
- What capabilities will improve quantitatively? (e.g., runtime, walking speed)
- What demonstrations will become reliable deployments?
- What new applications will emerge?

#### 10 Years (2034)
Consider **significant advances** requiring breakthroughs:
- What current "research demos" will be ready for commercial use?
- What new capabilities might emerge?
- How might manufacturing and cost change?

#### 20 Years (2044)
Think about **transformative change**:
- What might become possible that seems far-fetched today?
- How might the field look fundamentally different?
- What societal changes might widespread humanoid robots enable?

### Grounding Your Predictions

For each prediction, identify:
- What technological advance would enable it
- What current research is moving in that direction
- What obstacles must be overcome
- How confident you are (high/medium/low)

### Deliverable

Create a "Future of Humanoid Robotics" timeline with:
- 3-5 predictions for each time horizon
- Brief justification for each prediction
- Identification of enabling technologies
- Confidence levels

## Try With AI

Now that you've conducted research and made predictions, let's use AI to challenge and refine your thinking.

### Initial Request

> "I've been researching humanoid robots and their applications. I concluded that [your chosen platform from Exercise 2] is best suited for [your chosen scenario] because [brief justification]. Can you play devil's advocate and argue why a different platform or approach might be better? Consider technical limitations, cost-effectiveness, and practical deployment challenges."

### Critical Evaluation

Review the AI's counter-arguments:

- [ ] **Are the criticisms technically valid?** (Based on your research and understanding)
- [ ] **Did the AI identify limitations you overlooked?** (Good challenge to your reasoning)
- [ ] **Are the alternative suggestions realistic?** (Or wishful thinking about robot capabilities?)
- [ ] **Does it consider practical constraints** (cost, availability, maintenance)?

### Focused Update

Respond to the AI's strongest critique:

> "You raised a good point about [specific limitation]. Given that constraint, what modifications or supporting systems would be needed to make my recommended platform viable for this application? Be specific about hardware additions, software requirements, or operational procedures."

### Second Iteration

Test your future predictions:

> "I predicted that by [year], humanoid robots will be able to [specific capability]. Based on current technological trends, is this timeline realistic, too optimistic, or too conservative? What factors might accelerate or delay this capability?"

### Reflection

1. **Challenging Assumptions**: Did the AI's devil's advocate argument reveal assumptions you made without sufficient evidence? How did defending your position strengthen or change your reasoning?

2. **Solution Thinking**: When the AI suggested modifications to address limitations, were they practical engineering solutions or vague aspirations? How can you tell the difference?

3. **Prediction Quality**: When evaluating your timeline predictions, did the AI provide insight into technological dependencies you hadn't considered? Or did it merely agree/disagree without substantive reasoning?

**Key Insight**: Using AI as a critical thinking partner works best when you have enough domain knowledge to:
- Recognize valid criticisms from weak objections
- Evaluate whether proposed solutions are technically feasible
- Assess whether the AI's reasoning is grounded in physics and engineering reality

This lab has given you practice in research, critical evaluation, and informed speculation—all crucial skills for working in Physical AI.
