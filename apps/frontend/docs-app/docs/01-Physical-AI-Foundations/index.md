# Part 1: Physical AI Foundations

Welcome to your journey into Physical AI. Before we write any code or run any simulations, we need to build a solid mental model of what makes robots different from the AI systems you may already know.

## What You'll Learn

In this part, you'll explore three fundamental questions:

1. **What makes Physical AI different?** — Understanding why a robot navigating a room faces challenges that a chatbot never encounters
2. **How do robots sense and move?** — Discovering the sensors that give robots awareness and the actuators that let them act
3. **Where is humanoid robotics today?** — Surveying the current landscape of humanoid robots and their capabilities

## Chapters

### Chapter 1: What Is Physical AI?

Explore the fundamental differences between digital AI (like chatbots) and Physical AI (like walking robots). Learn about the embodiment hypothesis and why understanding physics matters for robot intelligence.

### Chapter 2: Sensors, Actuators & The Humanoid Body Plan

Discover how robots perceive the world through LIDAR, cameras, and IMUs. Understand how actuators translate electrical signals into physical movement. See how humanoid robots are designed to navigate human spaces.

### Chapter 3: The Humanoid Robotics Landscape

Survey the current state of humanoid robotics, from Boston Dynamics Atlas to Tesla Optimus. Understand the technical challenges that remain and where the field is heading.

## Why Start Here?

You might be eager to start coding or running simulations. But the most successful roboticists understand the fundamentals deeply. The concepts in this part will help you:

- **Ask better questions** when debugging robot behavior
- **Make better design decisions** when building robot systems
- **Communicate effectively** with teams working on Physical AI

## Time Investment

This part represents approximately **8-10 hours** of focused learning, typically completed over **Weeks 1-2** of the course. This includes reading all lessons, completing reflection questions, and working through the "Try With AI" exercises.

## Ready?

Start with [Chapter 1: What Is Physical AI?](./01-what-is-physical-ai/) to begin your exploration of embodied intelligence.
