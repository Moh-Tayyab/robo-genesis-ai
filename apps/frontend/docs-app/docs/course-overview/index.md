# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.**

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws.

You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using **ROS 2**, **Gazebo**, and **NVIDIA Isaac**.

---

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll create an **Autonomous Humanoid** that can:

1. Receive a voice command ("Pick up the red cup")
2. Understand the intent using a language model
3. Plan a path through the environment
4. Navigate around obstacles
5. Identify the target object using computer vision
6. Manipulate the object safely

This isn't science fiction—it's the technology powering the next generation of robots.

## Part 1: Physical AI Foundations (Weeks 1-2)

Before writing any code, we build intuition. What makes a robot "intelligent"? How do sensors give robots awareness? What's the difference between a robot arm in a factory and a humanoid that can walk through your home?

**Chapter 1: What Is Physical AI?**
- Digital AI vs Physical AI
- The Embodiment Hypothesis
- Real-world constraints (latency, power, safety)

**Chapter 2: Sensors, Actuators & The Humanoid Body Plan**
- How robots sense the world (LIDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- Actuators and movement
- The humanoid body plan

**Chapter 3: The Humanoid Robotics Landscape**
- Why humanoid form?
- Current platforms (Atlas, Figure 01, Optimus, Unitree G1)
- Challenges and future directions

---

## Part 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 3-5)

Every robot needs a way to coordinate its parts—sensors, motors, cameras, and AI models. **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) is the industry-standard middleware that makes this possible.

**You'll learn:**
- How ROS 2 connects different robot components
- Writing Python code that controls robots
- Describing robot structure with URDF files
- Bridging AI agents to ROS 2 controllers

---

## Part 3: Simulation Systems (Weeks 6-7)

Before deploying to expensive hardware, we test everything in simulation. A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of your robot that behaves like the real thing.

**You'll learn:**
- Setting up physics-accurate simulations in Gazebo
- Simulating sensors (cameras, LIDAR, depth sensors)
- High-fidelity visualization in Unity (optional)
- Testing robot behaviors safely before real-world deployment

---

## Part 4: NVIDIA Isaac AI (Weeks 8-10)

NVIDIA Isaac brings cutting-edge AI to robotics—photorealistic simulation, hardware-accelerated perception, and tools for training robots at scale.

**You'll learn:**
- Running Isaac Sim for high-fidelity robot simulation
- Visual SLAM for robot navigation
- Path planning for bipedal movement
- Transferring trained models from simulation to real robots

---

## Part 5: Vision-Language-Action (Weeks 11-12)

This is where everything converges. Language models meet robotics. Voice commands become robot actions.

**You'll learn:**
- Converting speech to text with Whisper
- Using LLMs to plan robot actions from natural language
- Building safe pipelines where AI suggestions are validated before execution

---

## Part 6: Capstone Project (Week 13)

Put it all together. Your simulated humanoid receives voice commands, plans intelligently, navigates safely, and manipulates objects—all while you ensure safety constraints are respected.

---

## What You'll Be Able To Do

After completing this course, you will:

- **Explain** how Physical AI differs from traditional software AI
- **Build** ROS 2 applications that control robot behavior
- **Simulate** robots in Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **Design** perception pipelines for navigation and object detection
- **Integrate** language models with robot control systems
- **Create** voice-controlled robots with safety-first design

---

## Hardware You'll Use

This course involves real computing power. Here's what you'll work with:

### Your Workstation

| Component | What You Need |
|-----------|---------------|
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti or better |
| CPU | Modern Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 9 |
| RAM | 64 GB recommended |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 |

> **Why these specs?** NVIDIA Isaac Sim requires RTX GPUs for ray tracing. Physics simulation and AI models need serious compute power.

### Edge AI Kit (The Robot Brain)

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano | Runs AI models on the robot |
| Intel RealSense D435i | Gives the robot depth vision |
| USB Microphone Array | Enables voice commands |

### The Robots

We primarily work in simulation, but the code you write can deploy to real robots like the **Unitree Go2** (quadruped) or **Unitree G1** (humanoid).

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have:

- **Python proficiency** — You're comfortable writing Python code
- **Basic AI/ML knowledge** — You understand what neural networks do
- **Curiosity about robotics** — No prior ROS experience needed

---

## How This Course Works

Each lesson follows a pattern:

1. **Concept** — We explain the idea with analogies and diagrams
2. **Hands-on** — You build something that works
3. **Try With AI** — You collaborate with AI to extend and debug your work

This isn't a course where you passively watch videos. You'll be writing code, running simulations, and building real robotics skills.

## Ready to Begin?

Start with **Part 1: Physical AI Foundations** to build your understanding of embodied intelligence before diving into code.

---

## Try With AI

Before diving in, try this with your AI assistant:

> "I want to understand Physical AI. Can you explain the difference between a chatbot (digital AI) and a robot that can walk through a room and pick up objects (physical AI)? What additional challenges does the robot face?"

Evaluate the response:
- Did it mention sensing and perception?
- Did it discuss the need to understand physics?
- Did it explain the challenge of acting in real-time?

This kind of critical evaluation is how you'll learn throughout this course.
