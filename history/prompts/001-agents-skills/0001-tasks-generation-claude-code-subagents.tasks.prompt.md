## Prompt

/sp.tasks no break this plan into tasks

User requested task generation from the plan.md and spec.md for the 001-agents-skills feature. The feature involves creating Claude Code subagents (markdown files with YAML frontmatter in .claude/agents/) and skills (folders with SKILL.md in .claude/skills/).

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 54 tasks organized across 9 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (3 tasks) - Directory structure creation
2. **Phase 2: Foundational Skills** (24 tasks) - All 9 skills with supporting files
3. **Phase 3: US1 Content** (4 tasks) - Core content subagents (super-orchestra, chapter-planner, lesson-writer, safety-reviewer)
4. **Phase 4: US2 Robotics** (2 tasks) - Robotics subagents
5. **Phase 5: US3 Platform** (7 tasks) - Software subagents (monorepo, docusaurus, rag, auth, chatkit, gpu, deployment)
6. **Phase 6: US4 Translation** (1 task) - Translator subagent
7. **Phase 7: US5 Review** (2 tasks) - Reviewer subagents
8. **Phase 8: US6 Validation** (4 tasks) - Skills validation
9. **Phase 9: Polish** (7 tasks) - Final validation

Key characteristics:
- 43 of 54 tasks can run in parallel
- MVP scope: Phases 1-4 (33 tasks)
- Tasks mapped to 6 user stories from spec.md
- Skills must be created before subagents that reference them

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated complete task list for feature implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No code tests - markdown configuration files only
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-agents-skills/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story enables independent implementation and MVP delivery

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - task generation
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute MVP tasks (Phases 1-4) and validate subagent discovery
