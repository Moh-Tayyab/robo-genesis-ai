## Prompt

write plan for making this spec

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Claude Code Subagents and Skills System.

**Technical Context:**
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Dependencies: OpenAI Agents SDK, Pydantic, YAML
- Storage: File-based (YAML/JSON for definitions, markdown for prompts)
- Testing: pytest with mock LLM responses
- Target: Claude Code CLI integration

**Constitution Check:** All gates PASS
- III. Strict Technical Stack ✅
- VII. Content Agents Specification ✅
- VIII. Software-Building Agents Specification ✅
- IX. Quality & Verification ✅
- X. Spec-First Development ✅

**Project Structure:**
- `agents/` directory with base classes, content subagents (8), software subagents (8)
- `agents/skills/` with 5 categories (shared, content, robotics, translation, platform)
- `agents/prompts/` with markdown templates for each subagent
- `tests/` with unit, integration, and contract tests

**Phase 0 - Research Completed:**
1. OpenAI Agents SDK patterns → Prompt-based subagent architecture
2. Skill implementation → Python functions with Pydantic schemas
3. Prompt templates → Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
4. Constitution validation → Multi-level (schema → rules → semantic)

**Phase 1 - Design Artifacts:**
- data-model.md: 6 core entities, 16 subagent definitions, 18 skill definitions
- contracts/skill-schemas.yaml: Input/output schemas for all skills
- contracts/subagent-schemas.yaml: I/O schemas for content and software subagents
- quickstart.md: Usage guide with workflows and examples

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete architectural design for subagent system
- Tests: N/A (planning phase)
- Files: 6 planning artifacts created
- Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate implementation tasks
- Reflection: Research phase resolved key decisions; design provides clear contracts for implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS (all constitution gates passed)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate skill schemas are complete during task generation
