## Prompt

lets setup the spec for setting up the monorepo in which we will first add the docasurus website for the content for your help here is some conetent ```Prerequisites
Node.js 20+ installed
pnpm installed (npm install -g pnpm)
Step 1: Initialize Monorepo with Turborepo
Create the monorepo structure using Turborepo:

# Create project directory
mkdir sso-monorepo && cd sso-monorepo

# Initialize with Turborepo
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest . --package-manager pnpm

# When prompted:
# - Where would you like to create your turborepo? . (current directory)
# - Which package manager? pnpm
After completion, clean up the default apps and packages:

# Remove default example apps and packages
rm -rf apps/* packages/*

# Your structure should now be:
# sso-monorepo/
# ├── turbo.json
# ├── package.json
# ├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
# └── (empty apps and packages folders)
Step 2: Create Next.js Applications``` u can use the dediected subagents u have for this as well

## Response snapshot

Created feature specification for monorepo setup with Docusaurus:
- Branch: `002-monorepo-docusaurus-setup`
- Spec file: `specs/002-monorepo-docusaurus-setup/spec.md`
- 4 user stories (P1: monorepo init + docusaurus site, P2: dev workflow, P3: shared configs)
- 10 functional requirements covering Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, Docusaurus config
- 6 measurable success criteria
- Quality checklist: all items PASS

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete feature specification ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist - all items passed
- 📁 Files: 2 files created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.clarify` (optional) or `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: User provided clear technology choices (Turborepo, pnpm, Docusaurus) - no clarification needed

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification was clear from user input
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - spec complete
