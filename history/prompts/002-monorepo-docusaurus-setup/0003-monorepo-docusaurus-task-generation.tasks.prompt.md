## Prompt

create tasks for the plan we have

## Response snapshot

Generated 33 implementation tasks organized by user story:

**Phase Structure**:
- Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks) - Create monorepo skeleton
- Phase 2: Foundational (3 tasks) - Verify foundation works
- Phase 3: US1 (4 tasks) - Empty monorepo validation
- Phase 4: US2 (11 tasks) - Docusaurus app setup
- Phase 5: US3 (5 tasks) - Root-level commands
- Phase 6: US4 (0 tasks) - DEFERRED (out of scope)
- Phase 7: Polish (4 tasks) - Final verification

**Key Metrics**:
- Total Tasks: 33
- MVP Scope: 15 tasks (US1 + US2)
- Parallel Opportunities: 6 tasks marked [P]
- Deferred: US4 (shared configs)

**All tasks follow checklist format**: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task list ready for implementation via /sp.implement
- 🧪 Tests: No tests requested in spec - verification tasks included instead
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to execute tasks, or manual task execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story with clear dependencies; US4 properly deferred per spec

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Task format validation PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - tasks complete
