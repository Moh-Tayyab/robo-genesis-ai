## Prompt

/sp.implement but use dedicated subagents for monoepo and docusaurus

(User requested implementation of the monorepo setup using dedicated subagents: `monorepo-architect` for Turborepo configuration and `docusaurus-architect` for Docusaurus setup)

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented 32 of 33 tasks using dedicated subagents:

**Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)**
- Created root package.json with Turborepo
- Created pnpm-workspace.yaml
- Created turbo.json with task pipelines
- Created apps/ and packages/ directories
- Updated .gitignore

**Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T009)**
- Verified pnpm install works
- Verified turbo run build works
- Verified directory structure

**Phase 3-4: Docusaurus (T014-T024)**
- Initialized Docusaurus 3.x with TypeScript
- Configured docs-only mode
- Added local search plugin
- Fixed Prism language configuration error

**Phase 5: Root Commands (T025-T029)**
- Verified root-level dev/build commands
- Verified Turborepo caching (83ms cache hit)

**Error Fixed:**
- Prism language 'xml' not supported - changed to 'json'
- Build succeeded after fix

## Outcome

- Impact: Full monorepo with Docusaurus app operational
- Tests: All build and validation tests passed
- Files: 11 files created/modified across root and apps/docs/
- Next prompts: T033 commit, deploy to GitHub Pages
- Reflection: Dedicated subagents provided focused implementation; error was quickly identified and fixed

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Prism language configuration required valid language names
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all success criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Used monorepo-architect and docusaurus-architect subagents
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add more Prism languages as needed for robotics content
