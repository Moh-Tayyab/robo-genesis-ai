## Prompt

Write the Part 1 Summary and Transition Check for the Physical AI Foundations course.

**CRITICAL**: This is Layer 1 (Conceptual Foundations) content. NO executable code blocks allowed. Student-facing language only. MUST end with "## Try With AI" section.

**File to create:**

`/home/dell/robo-genesis-ai/apps/docs/docs/01-Physical-AI-Foundations/04-part-summary.md`

```

**Required Sections:**

1. **Key Concepts Review**
   - Recap Physical AI vs Digital AI
   - Recap sensors (LIDAR, cameras, IMU, force/torque)
   - Recap actuators and humanoid body plan
   - Recap current humanoid robot landscape

2. **Transition Check Exercise**
   - Instructions: "Sketch and annotate a humanoid robot"
   - Requirements:
     - Label at least 4 different sensors
     - Identify at least 6 major joints
     - Show degrees of freedom for key joints
     - Indicate sensor placement locations

3. **Self-Evaluation Checklist**
   Create a checklist with items like:
   - [ ] I can explain the difference between digital AI and Physical AI
   - [ ] I can name 4 types of sensors robots use
   - [ ] I can explain what an IMU does
   - [ ] I can describe degrees of freedom
   - [ ] I can name 3 current humanoid robot platforms
   - [ ] I understand the major challenges in humanoid robotics

4. **What's Next: Part 2 Preview**
   - Brief intro to ROS 2
   - What students will build
   - Hardware requirements for Part 2

5. **Try With AI Section**
   - Students can use AI to evaluate their sketch
   - Include all 5 parts:
     - Initial Request: "I've sketched a humanoid robot with these labels... Can you evaluate if I've correctly identified the key components?"
     - Critical Evaluation: Checklist for verifying AI response
     - Focused Update: Follow-up prompt
     - Second Iteration: Iteration prompt
     - Reflection: Questions about what they learned

Create engaging content that helps students assess their readiness for Part 2 (ROS 2 Fundamentals).

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Part 1 Summary and Transition Check document with:

**Content Structure**:
- Engaging introduction explaining the purpose as a checkpoint, not a test
- Four-part key concepts review covering Physical AI vs Digital AI, sensors, actuators/body plan, and humanoid landscape
- Each concept recap includes brief explanations and "Analogy Recap" callbacks to earlier lessons
- Detailed transition check exercise with clear sketch requirements and reflection prompts
- Comprehensive self-evaluation checklist with 20+ items organized by topic area
- Guidance on what to do if gaps are identified
- Preview of Part 2 (ROS 2) explaining what students will learn and build
- Hardware requirements section reassuring students simulation is sufficient

**Try With AI Section** (5-part structure):
1. Initial Request: Prompt template for students to describe their sketch
2. Critical Evaluation: Verification checklist with red flags to watch for
3. Focused Update: Follow-up prompt after making improvements
4. Second Iteration: Readiness assessment prompt
5. Reflection: Three categories of questions (understanding, AI as tool, moving forward)

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ Layer 1: Conceptual only, NO executable code blocks
- ✅ Student-facing language: No internal labels (L1, etc.) exposed
- ✅ Analogies: Multiple analogy recaps throughout
- ✅ Ends with "Try With AI" as final section
- ✅ No prohibited end sections (no "What's Next" header at end, integrated into flow)
- ✅ Encouragement without condescension
- ✅ Clear prerequisites and readiness guidance

**Pedagogical Features**:
- Self-directed assessment approach
- Growth mindset messaging ("This isn't a test you can fail")
- Multiple entry points for review based on checklist results
- Bridges Part 1 concepts to Part 2 application
- Uses the sketch exercise to verify integrated understanding across chapters
- AI prompts designed to reveal gaps and strengthen understanding

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created transition checkpoint for Part 1, enabling students to self-assess readiness for ROS 2 content
- 🧪 Tests: Manual constitution compliance review required
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (04-part-summary.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Could create individual chapter lessons (01-03) for Part 1 to complete the section
- 🧠 Reflection: The "Try With AI" section uses the sketch exercise effectively as a concrete artifact for evaluation, making the AI interaction more grounded than abstract Q&A

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None detected
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review pending
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding visual examples or sample sketches to guide students on what "annotated sketch" should look like
