## Prompt

Add content personalization with onboarding questionnaire and lesson adaptation based on user profile.

User clarifications:
- Use SQLAlchemy + Alembic (not Drizzle since backend is Python)
- Skip auth for MVP - use localStorage user_id
- Extended 6 questions: education, programming, robotics, AI/ML, goals, language
- On-demand personalization with caching
- NeonDB serverless Postgres for storage

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive spec.md with:
- 4 User Stories (P1: Onboarding, P1: View Personalized, P2: Update Prefs, P3: Caching)
- 24 Functional Requirements covering user management, onboarding, personalization, caching
- 7 Measurable Success Criteria
- 5 Edge Cases documented
- Key entities: User, UserPreferences, PersonalizedContentCache

## Outcome

- Impact: Established complete specification for content personalization feature
- Tests: Requirements checklist passed all validation checks
- Files: spec.md (147 lines), requirements.md checklist
- Next prompts: /sp.plan to create architecture, /sp.tasks for implementation breakdown
- Reflection: Spec covers all user journeys from onboarding through caching

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean spec creation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Requirements checklist PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify flow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - proceeding to plan phase
