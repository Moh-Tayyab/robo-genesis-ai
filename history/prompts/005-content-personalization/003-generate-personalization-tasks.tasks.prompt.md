## Prompt

make tasks

Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for the content personalization feature based on available design artifacts.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 50 tasks organized by user story:

**Phase Structure**:
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks) - Database, models, context
- Phase 3: US1 Onboarding (10 tasks) - MVP foundation
- Phase 4: US2 Personalized Content (10 tasks) - Core value
- Phase 5: US3 Update Preferences (6 tasks) - User control
- Phase 6: US4 Caching (5 tasks) - Performance
- Phase 7: Polish (5 tasks) - Integration testing

**Task Distribution**:
- Total: 50 tasks
- Parallelizable [P]: 18 tasks
- MVP Scope: US1 + US2 (24 tasks after Foundation)

**Key Deliverables**:
- Checklist format with [TaskID] [P?] [Story] pattern
- Clear file paths for every task
- Dependency graph showing user story order
- Parallel execution examples
- MVP-first implementation strategy

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete implementation roadmap ready for execution
- Tests: Format validation passed, all stories covered
- Files: tasks.md (252 lines)
- Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin implementation
- Reflection: Well-balanced task distribution across user stories

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean task generation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Task format validation PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks flow with user story organization
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - proceeding to implementation
