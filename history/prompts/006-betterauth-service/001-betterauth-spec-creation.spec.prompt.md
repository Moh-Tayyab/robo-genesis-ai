## Prompt

User requested to add BetterAuth authentication as a standalone Next.js service. Key requirements gathered through clarification:

1. **Existing Reference**: User has working BetterAuth SSO project at `/home/dell/pana-sso/sso/sso-monorepo`
2. **Architecture**: Standalone auth service (separate app, not embedded)
3. **Auth Type**: Basic email/password only (no social OAuth)
4. **Database**: Separate NeonDB with Drizzle ORM
5. **Email Verification**: Skip for MVP
6. **Port**: 3001
7. **Integration**: Must work with Docusaurus (3000) and FastAPI backend (8000)

User explicitly requested using `/sp.specify` workflow to create proper spec before implementation, emphasizing to use the SSO project as base pattern source.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification with:
- 4 user stories (Create Account, Sign In, Session Across Sites, Backend API Auth)
- 12 functional requirements covering auth service, user management, session handling, integration
- 4 non-functional requirements (performance, security, cookies, error handling)
- 7 measurable success criteria
- Key entities: User, Session, Account, Verification
- Clear out-of-scope items (email verification, password reset, OAuth, 2FA, OIDC)
- Dependencies and reference implementation documented

Created requirements checklist with all items validated and passing.

## Outcome

- Impact: Comprehensive spec created for BetterAuth authentication service feature
- Tests: Requirements checklist validation passed
- Files: 2 files created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- Next prompts: Run /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- Reflection: Clear requirements gathered through targeted questions; reference implementation provides solid patterns to follow

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - user provided clear existing project reference
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all checklist items validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding architecture diagram in plan phase
