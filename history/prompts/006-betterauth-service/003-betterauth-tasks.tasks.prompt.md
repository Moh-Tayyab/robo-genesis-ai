## Prompt

create the tasks for the plan please

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 66 tasks organized into 7 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup (11 tasks)** - T001-T011
- Package creation (auth-database, auth-config)
- Drizzle schema and database connection
- Next.js app scaffolding

**Phase 2: Foundational (10 tasks)** - T012-T021
- BetterAuth server/client configuration
- API route handler with CORS
- Shared UI components (PasswordInput, FormError)

**Phase 3: US1 - Create Account (8 tasks)** - T022-T029
- Signup page and form
- Validation and error handling
- Redirect after success

**Phase 4: US2 - Sign In (8 tasks)** - T030-T037
- Signin page and form
- Authentication flow
- Error handling for invalid credentials

**Phase 5: US3 - Sessions (10 tasks)** - T038-T047
- UserContext update for auth
- AuthButton component for docs site
- Sign out functionality

**Phase 6: US4 - Backend Auth (11 tasks)** - T048-T058
- Auth middleware for FastAPI
- Session validation via HTTP
- Protected endpoint updates

**Phase 7: Polish (8 tasks)** - T059-T066
- Loading states, style polish
- Validation and documentation

**Summary**:
- Total: 66 tasks
- MVP Scope: 29 tasks (Phases 1-3)
- Full Scope: 66 tasks (all phases)
- Parallel opportunities: US1/US2 can run in parallel, US4 independent

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete implementation task list ready for execution
- Tests: All 66 tasks follow required checklist format
- Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- Next prompts: Run /sp.implement to execute tasks
- Reflection: User stories map cleanly to phases, enabling incremental delivery

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clear spec and plan enabled clean task generation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - format validation
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding time estimates per phase
