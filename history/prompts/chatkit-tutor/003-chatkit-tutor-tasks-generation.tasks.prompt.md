# ChatKit Tutor Tasks Generation

## Prompt

User ran `/sp.tasks` with argument "make the task for the plan" to generate implementation tasks for the ChatKit AI Robotics Tutor feature.

## Response

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 42 tasks organized by user story:

**Phase Structure**:
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Project structure initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks) - BLOCKING prerequisites
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (11 tasks) - Core Q&A functionality 🎯 MVP
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (5 tasks) - Expanded chat panel
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (5 tasks) - Context-aware help
- Phase 6: Polish (8 tasks) - Error handling, edge cases

**Task Breakdown by Component**:

Backend tasks (packages/chatkit-backend/):
- Pydantic models (messages.py)
- LLM factory (factory.py)
- Robotics Tutor Agent (tutor.py)
- Event router with SSE (router.py)
- FastAPI main app (main.py)

Frontend tasks (apps/docs/src/components/ChatKit/):
- ChatMessage.tsx - message display
- FloatingChatBar.tsx - main chat input
- ChatPanel.tsx - expanded view
- Root.tsx - global injection
- chatkit.css - styles
- types.ts - TypeScript interfaces

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- Phase 1: 3 tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 2: 6 tasks can run in parallel (backend models + frontend foundation)
- Phase 3: Backend and frontend tracks can be partially parallel
- Phase 6: 5 tasks can run in parallel

**MVP Recommendation**:
For hackathon, complete Phases 1-3 only (24 tasks) for a fully functional chat Q&A system.

**Format Validation**:
- All 42 tasks follow checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Task IDs sequential from T001-T042
- [P] marker used for parallelizable tasks
- [US1], [US2], [US3] labels for user story phases
- File paths included in all task descriptions

## Outcome

Created `specs/004-chatkit-tutor/tasks.md` with:
- 42 total tasks
- 6 phases (Setup, Foundational, US1, US2, US3, Polish)
- Clear dependency graph
- Parallel execution examples
- MVP-first implementation strategy
- Time estimates per phase

Ready for `/sp.implement` to begin execution.
