## Prompt

create the 003-introduction-to-physical-ai

User requested creation of specification for Introduction to Physical AI - the Weeks 1-2 foundational content covering Physical AI concepts and embodied intelligence. This is Layer 1 (Conceptual Foundations) content that builds mental models before any code.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Introduction to Physical AI module:

- **4 User Stories**: Physical AI Fundamentals (P1), Robot Perception (P2), Humanoid Landscape (P3), Transition Check (P4)
- **10 Functional Requirements**: FR-001 through FR-010 covering lesson structure, content constraints, and pedagogy rules
- **9 Success Criteria**: SC-001 through SC-009 with measurable outcomes
- **4 Lessons Outlined**: What is Physical AI, Embodied Intelligence, Robot Sensors, Humanoid Landscape
- **Quality Checklist**: All items passed validation

Key decisions:
- Layer 1 enforcement: No executable code in this module
- "Try With AI" pattern required for all lessons
- Transition check: Student must sketch and annotate robot
- Urdu translation support with English technical terms

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Specification ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist passed all items
- 📁 Files: 2 files created (spec.md, requirements.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan or /sp.clarify
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec aligns well with curriculum.md; Layer 1 constraints properly enforced

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean first-pass generation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content quality PASS, Requirement completeness PASS, Feature readiness PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify flow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate lesson structure against constitution "Try With AI" 5-part pattern during plan phase
