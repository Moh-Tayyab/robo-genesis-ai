## Prompt

lets make

User requested creation of implementation plan for Introduction to Physical AI content module.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan with Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts:

**Phase 0 - Research (research.md)**:
- Lesson structure for Layer 1 content
- "Try With AI" pattern implementation
- Diagram requirements and format (SVG)
- Docusaurus file organization
- Urdu translation approach
- Hardware requirements presentation

**Phase 1 - Design (data-model.md, quickstart.md)**:
- Entity definitions: Lesson, Module, Transition Check, Try With AI Section, Diagram
- File naming conventions
- Content inventory
- Quickstart guide for content authors

**Plan.md Summary**:
- Constitution Check: All 8 principles PASS
- 5 Design Decisions documented with rationale
- Content outline for 4 lessons + transition check
- Project structure for Docusaurus integration

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan ready for task generation
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution check passed all principles
- 📁 Files: 4 files created (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Content-first approach appropriate for educational feature

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean generation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check PASS (8/8 principles)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan flow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate lesson writing against quickstart guide during implementation
