## Prompt

lets convert these into tasks now

User requested generation of implementation tasks from the design documents (spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md) for the Introduction to Physical AI module.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 47 tasks organized by user story:

**Phase Summary**:
- Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks) - Folder structure
- Phase 2: Foundational (3 tasks) - Diagrams (blocking)
- Phase 3: US1 - Physical AI Fundamentals (12 tasks) - Lessons 1-2
- Phase 4: US2 - Robot Perception (9 tasks) - Lesson 3
- Phase 5: US3 - Humanoid Landscape (8 tasks) - Lesson 4
- Phase 6: US4 - Transition Check (5 tasks) - Assessment
- Phase 7: Polish (7 tasks) - Integration & validation

**Task Distribution**:
- Total Tasks: 47
- Tasks per User Story: US1=12, US2=9, US3=8, US4=5
- Parallel Opportunities: 8 tasks marked [P]
- MVP Scope: 18 tasks (through T018)

**Format Validation**: All tasks follow checklist format:
- Checkbox: ✅
- Task ID: ✅ (T001-T047)
- [P] markers: ✅ (where applicable)
- [Story] labels: ✅ (US1-US4 for story phases)
- File paths: ✅

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Tasks ready for implementation via /sp.implement
- 🧪 Tests: Format validation passed
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute tasks, or manual implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Task granularity appropriate for content creation; each lesson broken into sections

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean generation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS, Completeness PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks flow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test MVP delivery (US1 only) before full implementation
