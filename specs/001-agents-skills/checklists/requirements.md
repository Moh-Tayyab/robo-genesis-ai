# Specification Quality Checklist: Claude Code Subagents and Skills System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Validation Run 2 (2025-11-29) - REVISED

**Status**: PASS

**Architecture Correction Applied**: Spec rewritten from subagent perspective where:
- Claude Code CLI = Orchestrator (human interacts with this)
- Subagents = Specialized agents Claude Code spawns for domain tasks
- Skills = Reusable tools subagents use

**Items Reviewed**:

1. **Correct perspective**: PASS - User stories now describe Claude Code spawning subagents, not users invoking agents directly.

2. **No implementation details**: PASS - Spec describes subagent capabilities and skills without specifying internal code structure.

3. **User value focus**: PASS - Human asks Claude Code → Claude Code orchestrates subagents → Human gets result. Seamless experience.

4. **Testable requirements**: PASS - 27 FRs with specific verifiable outcomes (e.g., "Claude Code MUST spawn Chapter-Planner subagent with chapter topic, target layer, and prerequisites as context").

5. **Skills catalog**: PASS - Initial set of 18 skills defined across categories (shared, content, robotics, translation, platform).

6. **Edge cases**: PASS - Four edge cases covering ambiguous delegation, constitution violations, subagent collaboration, and missing skills.

7. **Subagent chaining**: PASS - FR-004 explicitly requires Claude Code to chain subagent outputs.

8. **Assumptions documented**: PASS - OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Code as orchestrator, skills as prompts/functions.

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- 27 functional requirements covering orchestration, 16 subagents, and skills system
- 8 success criteria focus on observable outcomes (spawn time, compliance rate, format accuracy)
- Skills catalog provides concrete starting point for implementation
- Constitution compliance integrated into subagent behavior (FR-025 through FR-027)
