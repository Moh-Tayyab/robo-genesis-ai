# Feature Specification: Claude Code Subagents and Skills System

**Feature Branch**: `001-agents-skills`
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Updated**: 2025-11-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we first need to create the agents, and their skills for the project"

## Overview

This specification defines the **Claude Code subagent architecture** for the AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project. Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter that Claude Code can delegate tasks to. Each subagent has its own context window, specialized system prompt, and configurable tool access.

**Architecture (per Claude Code documentation):**
- **Claude Code CLI** = Main orchestrator (what the human interacts with)
- **Subagents** = Markdown files in `.claude/agents/` with YAML frontmatter defining persona and tools
- **Skills** = Folders containing `SKILL.md` files in `.claude/skills/` that extend Claude's capabilities

**Key Characteristics - Subagents:**
- Subagents are NOT Python code - they are configuration files
- Each subagent operates in its own context window (prevents context pollution)
- Subagents can use Claude Code's built-in tools (Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash, etc.)
- Model can be specified per subagent (sonnet, opus, haiku, or 'inherit')
- Subagents can reference Skills via `skills` frontmatter field

**Key Characteristics - Skills:**
- Skills are **folders** containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter
- Skills are **model-invoked** - Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on description
- Skills can include supporting files (reference.md, scripts/, templates/)
- Skills can restrict tool access via `allowed-tools` frontmatter field
- Skills provide domain knowledge, templates, and specialized workflows

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Write Book Chapter with Subagent Delegation (Priority: P1)

A human asks Claude Code to write a chapter on "Introduction to ROS 2". Claude Code automatically delegates to the chapter-planner subagent which produces plan.md, then chains to lesson-writer subagent for each lesson.

**Why this priority**: This is the core workflow for book creation.

**Independent Test**: Ask Claude Code to plan a chapter and verify it invokes the chapter-planner subagent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude Code receives "Write chapter on ROS 2 basics for Layer 3", **When** it recognizes this as a chapter planning task, **Then** it delegates to chapter-planner subagent which reads the constitution and produces plan.md.

2. **Given** chapter-planner has produced plan.md, **When** Claude Code proceeds to lesson writing, **Then** it delegates to lesson-writer subagent with plan.md as context.

3. **Given** lessons are written, **When** Claude Code validates content, **Then** it delegates to safety-reviewer subagent which checks for robotics safety issues.

---

### User Story 2 - Generate Robotics Code with Specialist Subagent (Priority: P1)

A human asks Claude Code to create a URDF file for a humanoid robot or write ROS 2 nodes. Claude Code delegates to robotics-code-specialist subagent which has specialized prompts for URDF generation, ROS 2 patterns, and safety annotations.

**Why this priority**: Robotics code requires domain expertise embedded in the subagent's system prompt.

**Independent Test**: Ask Claude Code to create a URDF and verify the robotics-code-specialist subagent is invoked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude Code receives "Create URDF for two-wheeled robot with IMU sensor", **When** it identifies this as robotics code, **Then** it delegates to robotics-code-specialist subagent.

2. **Given** robotics-code-specialist is working, **When** it generates URDF, **Then** output includes joint limits, mass/inertia validation, and safety comments per the subagent's system prompt.

---

### User Story 3 - Build Platform Components with Software Subagents (Priority: P2)

A human asks Claude Code to set up the Docusaurus book site or create FastAPI RAG endpoints. Claude Code delegates to docusaurus-architect or rag-backend-engineer subagents which have system prompts enforcing the strict technical stack.

**Why this priority**: Platform infrastructure requires adherence to specific tech stack constraints.

**Independent Test**: Ask Claude Code to create a RAG endpoint and verify the rag-backend-engineer subagent produces FastAPI code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude Code receives "Create chapter ingestion endpoint for RAG", **When** it identifies this as backend work, **Then** it delegates to rag-backend-engineer subagent.

2. **Given** rag-backend-engineer is working, **When** it generates code, **Then** output follows FastAPI + Qdrant patterns per constitution.

---

### User Story 4 - Translate Lesson with Urdu Translator Subagent (Priority: P3)

A human asks Claude Code to translate a completed English lesson to Urdu. Claude Code delegates to translator-urdu subagent which preserves technical terms in English.

**Why this priority**: Bilingual support follows after core content creation.

**Independent Test**: Provide an English lesson and verify translator-urdu subagent output has technical terms in English with Urdu explanatory text.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude Code receives "Translate lesson-03-ros-nodes.md to Urdu", **When** it processes the request, **Then** it delegates to translator-urdu subagent.

2. **Given** translator-urdu is working, **When** it encounters "ROS 2 node", "Gazebo", "URDF", **Then** it preserves these terms in English per its system prompt.

---

### User Story 5 - Review and Validate Content Quality (Priority: P2)

A human asks Claude Code to review a chapter for pedagogy quality or RAG answerability. Claude Code delegates to pedagogy-reviewer or rag-answerability subagents.

**Why this priority**: Quality gates ensure content meets educational standards.

**Independent Test**: Provide content with known issues and verify the reviewer subagent identifies them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude Code receives "Review chapter for cognitive load", **When** it processes, **Then** it delegates to pedagogy-reviewer subagent.

2. **Given** pedagogy-reviewer analyzes content with too many concepts per lesson, **Then** it recommends splitting lessons per its system prompt.

---

### User Story 6 - Skills Auto-Invocation for Domain Tasks (Priority: P2)

A human asks Claude Code about URDF structure or ROS 2 patterns. Claude autonomously discovers and uses the relevant Skill (e.g., urdf-templates skill) based on the request context.

**Why this priority**: Skills reduce repetitive prompting and provide consistent domain expertise.

**Independent Test**: Ask about URDF structure and verify Claude uses the urdf-templates skill.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Claude Code receives "Show me the URDF structure for a mobile robot", **When** it processes, **Then** it autonomously uses the urdf-templates skill based on description match.

2. **Given** the ros2-patterns skill exists, **When** user asks "Create a ROS 2 publisher node", **Then** Claude uses the skill's templates and patterns.

3. **Given** a skill has `allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob`, **When** the skill is active, **Then** Claude can only use those tools (read-only mode).

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Claude Code cannot determine which subagent to use?
  - Claude Code asks the human for clarification before delegating
- What happens when a subagent's output violates constitution constraints?
  - Claude Code (main thread) validates output and either retries or reports to human
- What happens when multiple subagents need to collaborate?
  - Claude Code chains subagent invocations, passing output from one as context to another
