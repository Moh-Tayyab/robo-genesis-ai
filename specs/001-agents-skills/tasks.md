# Tasks: Claude Code Subagents and Skills System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-agents-skills/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), data-model.md

**Tests**: Not requested - this feature involves markdown configuration files only, no code tests needed.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Subagents**: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- **Skills**: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
- **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational Skills (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS subagent phases that reference skills
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 are both P1 - can proceed in parallel
  - US3 and US5 are both P2 - can proceed in parallel
  - US4 is P3 - lower priority, can proceed after P1 and P2
  - US6 validates skills - should run last before Polish
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on layer-definitions, lesson-structure, student-language-guide, safety-checklist skills
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on urdf-templates, ros2-patterns, safety-checklist skills
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on tech-stack-constraints skill
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on translation-glossary skill
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Depends on layer-definitions skill
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Depends on all skills being created

### Within Each User Story

- Skills MUST be created before subagents that reference them
- Subagent files are independent - can be created in parallel within a story
- Validation should follow creation

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All skill creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different folders)
- All subagent creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- US1 and US2 (both P1) can run in parallel after skills are ready
- US3 and US5 (both P2) can run in parallel
- Validation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Content Subagents)

```bash
# Launch all content subagents together (different files):
Task: "Create .claude/agents/content/super-orchestra.md"
Task: "Create .claude/agents/content/chapter-planner.md"
Task: "Create .claude/agents/content/lesson-writer.md"

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/folders, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story can be validated independently
- This feature creates markdown configuration files only - no code tests needed
- Commit after each phase or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
