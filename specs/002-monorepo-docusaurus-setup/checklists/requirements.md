# Specification Quality Checklist: Monorepo with Docusaurus Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Updated**: 2025-11-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS

All content focuses on what the system should do, not how. The spec describes user needs (developers, content authors) and measurable outcomes without prescribing specific code patterns or libraries.

### Requirement Completeness: PASS

- All requirements use testable language (MUST, can, will)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (time bounds, percentages)
- Clear scope boundaries via "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions documented
- Two-phase implementation clearly defined with dependencies

### Feature Readiness: PASS

- 4 user stories with prioritization (P1-P4)
- Each story has independent test criteria
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover error handling
- Clear phase separation (monorepo first, then Docusaurus app)

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- No clarification markers needed - requirements are clear from user input
- Technology choices (Turborepo, pnpm, Docusaurus) are explicit user requirements
- **Two-phase approach**:
  - Phase 1: Empty Turborepo monorepo (P1) - use `monorepo-architect` agent
  - Phase 2: Docusaurus in `apps/docs/` (P2) - use `docusaurus-architect` agent
- Shared packages (P4) marked as out of scope for initial implementation
