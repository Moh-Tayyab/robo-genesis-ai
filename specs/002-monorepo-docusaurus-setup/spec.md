# Feature Specification: Monorepo with Docusaurus Setup

**Feature Branch**: `002-monorepo-docusaurus-setup`
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Setup monorepo with Turborepo for project organization, with Docusaurus as the first application for hosting educational robotics content."

## Implementation Phases

This feature is implemented in two distinct phases:

1. **Phase 1 - Monorepo Foundation**: Initialize Turborepo monorepo with empty `apps/` and `packages/` directories
2. **Phase 2 - Docusaurus App**: Add Docusaurus as an application inside `apps/docs/`

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Initialize Empty Monorepo Structure (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to have a clean Turborepo monorepo with empty `apps/` and `packages/` directories so that I can add applications incrementally without leftover template code.

**Why this priority**: The monorepo foundation MUST exist before any applications can be added. This is the prerequisite for everything else.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the directory structure exists with empty `apps/` and `packages/` folders, and `pnpm install` runs successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Turborepo is initialized, **When** I inspect the root directory, **Then** I see `turbo.json`, `package.json`, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
2. **Given** the monorepo is initialized, **When** I inspect `apps/` directory, **Then** it is empty (default Turborepo apps removed).
3. **Given** the monorepo is initialized, **When** I inspect `packages/` directory, **Then** it is empty (default Turborepo packages removed).
4. **Given** the empty monorepo structure exists, **When** I run `pnpm install`, **Then** pnpm recognizes the workspace configuration without errors.
5. **Given** the empty monorepo exists, **When** I run `turbo run build`, **Then** Turborepo completes successfully (no apps to build yet).

### User Story 2 - Add Docusaurus App to Monorepo (Priority: P2)

As a content author, I want a Docusaurus-based documentation website added inside `apps/docs/` so that I can write and publish educational robotics content in markdown format.

**Why this priority**: P2 because it depends on User Story 1 (monorepo must exist first). This is the primary deliverable after the foundation is ready.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to `apps/docs/` and running the Docusaurus development server to view rendered content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the empty monorepo exists, **When** Docusaurus is added, **Then** it resides in `apps/docs/` directory.
2. **Given** Docusaurus is in `apps/docs/`, **When** I run `pnpm dev` from `apps/docs/`, **Then** the development server starts at `localhost:3000`.
3. **Given** the Docusaurus app exists, **When** I run `turbo run build` from monorepo root, **Then** Docusaurus builds successfully and outputs static files.
4. **Given** a markdown file exists in `apps/docs/docs/`, **When** the site builds, **Then** the content is rendered as a navigable documentation page.
5. **Given** the site is running, **When** I use the search functionality, **Then** it returns relevant documentation pages.

### User Story 3 - Root-Level Development Commands (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to run development commands from the monorepo root so that I can manage all apps without navigating into each directory.

**Why this priority**: P3 because the Docusaurus app works independently from `apps/docs/`. Root commands are a convenience improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build` from monorepo root and verifying they trigger the correct app commands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docusaurus is in `apps/docs/`, **When** I run `pnpm dev` from monorepo root, **Then** Turborepo starts the Docusaurus development server.
2. **Given** I am in the monorepo root, **When** I run `pnpm build`, **Then** all applications (including `apps/docs`) build with Turborepo caching.
3. **Given** I make a change to a markdown file in `apps/docs/docs/`, **When** the dev server is running, **Then** the change is reflected via hot-reload.

---

### User Story 4 - Shared Configuration Packages (Priority: P4)

As a developer, I want shared configuration packages (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.) in `packages/` so that all applications follow consistent code standards.

**Why this priority**: P4 because Docusaurus can function without shared configs. This is a future enhancement for when more apps are added.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a shared config package and verifying apps can import and extend it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a shared ESLint config exists in `packages/eslint-config/`, **When** `apps/docs` extends it, **Then** linting runs with the shared rules.
2. **Given** a shared TypeScript config exists in `packages/typescript-config/`, **When** an app extends it, **Then** TypeScript uses the shared settings.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when `node_modules` is corrupted or missing? System should recover via `pnpm install`.
- How does the system handle port conflicts when starting the dev server? Docusaurus should prompt or auto-select an available port.
- What happens when a build fails in `apps/docs`? Turborepo should report the failure clearly with file/line references.
- How does the system handle markdown syntax errors? Docusaurus should display helpful error messages during build.
- What happens if someone runs `pnpm dev` from root before any apps exist? Turborepo should complete without errors (no tasks to run).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Phase 1 - Monorepo Foundation**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST initialize Turborepo with pnpm as the package manager.
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defining `apps/*` and `packages/*` as workspace directories.
- **FR-003**: System MUST include a `turbo.json` configuration with build, dev, and lint pipelines.
- **FR-004**: System MUST have empty `apps/` directory (default Turborepo apps removed).
- **FR-005**: System MUST have empty `packages/` directory (default Turborepo packages removed).
- **FR-006**: System MUST use Node.js 20+ as the runtime requirement.

**Phase 2 - Docusaurus App**:
- **FR-007**: System MUST include a Docusaurus 3.x application in `apps/docs/`.
- **FR-008**: Docusaurus MUST be configured with navigation sidebar for documentation.
- **FR-009**: Docusaurus MUST include local search functionality for documentation content.
- **FR-010**: Docusaurus MUST support markdown-based content authoring.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support running `pnpm dev` from both `apps/docs/` and monorepo root.
- **FR-012**: System MUST support running `pnpm build` from both `apps/docs/` and monorepo root.

### Key Entities

- **Monorepo Root**: Top-level directory containing `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, root `package.json`, and `apps/` + `packages/` directories.
- **Application (App)**: A deployable unit residing in `apps/` directory. First app is `apps/docs` (Docusaurus).
- **Package**: A shared library or configuration in `packages/` directory, consumable by apps (empty initially).
- **Documentation Page**: A markdown file in `apps/docs/docs/` that Docusaurus renders as a web page.
- **Sidebar**: Navigation structure in `apps/docs/sidebars.js` defining documentation hierarchy.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

**Phase 1 - Monorepo**:
- **SC-001**: After Phase 1, `apps/` and `packages/` directories are empty (no default Turborepo templates).
- **SC-002**: Running `pnpm install` from root completes without errors.
- **SC-003**: Running `turbo run build` from root completes without errors (even with no apps).

**Phase 2 - Docusaurus**:
- **SC-004**: Developers can run `cd apps/docs && pnpm dev` to start Docusaurus in under 30 seconds.
- **SC-005**: Running `pnpm build` from monorepo root builds Docusaurus in under 60 seconds (initial build).
- **SC-006**: Subsequent builds with Turborepo caching complete in under 10 seconds when no changes detected.
- **SC-007**: Content authors can add a new markdown file in `apps/docs/docs/` and see it appear in navigation.
- **SC-008**: Site search returns relevant results for terms in documentation content.
- **SC-009**: Development server hot-reload reflects markdown changes in under 2 seconds.

## Assumptions

- Node.js 20+ and pnpm are pre-installed on developer machines.
- The project will use Docusaurus 3.x (latest stable version).
- Initial content structure will follow Docusaurus defaults with customization added later.
- The monorepo will eventually contain additional applications beyond Docusaurus (future scope).
- Deployment configuration is out of scope for this specification (separate feature).

## Out of Scope

- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Production deployment setup
- Custom Docusaurus theme development
- Authentication or access control for documentation
- Analytics integration
- Internationalization (i18n) setup
- Shared packages in `packages/` (P4 - future enhancement)
