# Specification Quality Checklist: Introduction to Physical AI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASSED

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| No implementation details | PASS | Spec focuses on content structure, not technology |
| User value focus | PASS | Clear student learning outcomes |
| Non-technical language | PASS | Accessible to educators and stakeholders |
| Mandatory sections | PASS | All sections completed |

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| No clarifications needed | PASS | All requirements are clear based on curriculum |
| Testable requirements | PASS | FR-001 through FR-010 are all verifiable |
| Measurable success criteria | PASS | SC-001 through SC-009 have specific metrics |
| Technology-agnostic | PASS | No frameworks, languages, or APIs mentioned |
| Acceptance scenarios | PASS | Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios |
| Edge cases | PASS | 3 edge cases identified with mitigations |
| Bounded scope | PASS | Clear out-of-scope section |
| Dependencies | PASS | Docusaurus, curriculum, constitution identified |

### Feature Readiness - PASSED

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Acceptance criteria | PASS | All 4 user stories have acceptance scenarios |
| Primary flows covered | PASS | Learning → Sensors → Landscape → Transition Check |
| Measurable outcomes | PASS | 9 success criteria with specific metrics |
| No implementation leak | PASS | Content-focused, not code-focused |

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- All items passed validation on first iteration
- Spec aligns with curriculum.md and constitution requirements
- Layer 1 (Conceptual Foundations) constraints are properly enforced
