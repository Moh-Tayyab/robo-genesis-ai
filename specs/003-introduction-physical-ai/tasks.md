## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on T005 (images folder exists)
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on T001, T002 (Part and Chapter 1 folders exist), T007 (diagram exists)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on T003 (Chapter 2 folder), T008, T009 (sensor diagrams exist)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on T004 (Chapter 3 folder); can run in parallel with US2 after US1 complete
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on all chapters (references content from them)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Diagrams)
    ↓
Phase 3 (US1: Chapter 1) ← MVP checkpoint
    ↓
Phase 4 (US2: Chapter 2) ─┬─ can parallel
Phase 5 (US3: Chapter 3) ─┘
    ↓
Phase 6 (US4: Part Summary)
    ↓
Phase 7 (Polish)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
```bash
# These can run in parallel (different folders):
Task T002-T005: Create chapter and images folders
```

**Phase 2 (Diagrams)**:
```bash
# All diagram tasks can run in parallel:
Task T007: embodied-intelligence.svg
Task T008: robot-morphology.svg
Task T009: sensor-placement.svg
Task T010: humanoid-body-plan.svg
```

**Phase 7 (Polish)**:
```bash
# These can run in parallel:
Task T070: Update course-overview
Task T072: Verify diagram references
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 - Chapter 1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Diagrams (T007-T010) - can use placeholders
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T028) → **MVP Checkpoint**
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Can a student learn Physical AI fundamentals?
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete MVP (US1 - Chapter 1)
2. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T029-T045) - adds sensor/body knowledge
3. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T046-T062) - adds landscape context
4. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (T063-T068) - adds assessment
5. Complete Phase 7: Polish (T069-T075)

### Single Developer Execution

Execute tasks in order: T001 → T002 → ... → T075
- Respect dependencies between phases
- Parallel tasks ([P]) can be batched if comfortable
- Commit after each phase completion

**Total Tasks**: 75
**Tasks per User Story**: US1=18, US2=17, US3=17, US4=6
**Parallel Opportunities**: 12 tasks marked [P]

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run simultaneously
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each lesson must end with "## Try With AI" section (FR-005)
- No executable code allowed in any lesson (FR-003)
- Verify each checkpoint before proceeding to next phase
- Commit after each phase completion
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-009) should be verified in Phase 7
- Structure follows project-index.md Part/Chapter/Lesson hierarchy
