# Specification Quality Checklist: ChatKit AI Robotics Tutor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on what/why, not how |
| Requirements | PASS | 15 FRs all testable, no clarifications needed |
| Success Criteria | PASS | 7 measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes |
| User Stories | PASS | 3 prioritized stories with acceptance scenarios |
| Edge Cases | PASS | 5 edge cases identified with expected behavior |
| Scope | PASS | Clear out-of-scope section defines boundaries |

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- No clarifications required - all requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section
- Hackathon focus: MVP features only, no auth, no persistence
