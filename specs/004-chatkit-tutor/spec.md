# Feature Specification: ChatKit AI Robotics Tutor

**Feature Branch**: `004-chatkit-tutor`
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement ChatKit floating chat interface with AI robotics tutor using OpenAI Agents SDK. Floating bottom-center design like Claude Code Docs. Factory pattern for OpenAI/Gemini switching. No user auth for hackathon demo. Text selection actions (explain, translate, summarize) that send to chat."

## Overview

This feature adds an AI-powered chat assistant to the AI-Native Robotics Textbook documentation site. Students can ask questions about robotics concepts, get clarification on lessons, and receive personalized guidance while learning. The chat interface appears as a floating input bar at the bottom-center of the screen, providing contextual help without disrupting the reading experience.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ask a Question While Reading (Priority: P1)

A student is reading a lesson about bipedal locomotion and encounters a concept they don't understand. Without leaving the page, they type a question into the floating chat bar and receive an immediate, contextual answer from the AI tutor.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling real-time Q&A during learning. Without this, the feature has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening any lesson page, typing a robotics question in the chat bar, and receiving a relevant response within seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any lesson page, **When** I click the chat input bar, **Then** I can type my question and the input is focused
2. **Given** I have typed a question, **When** I press Enter or click send, **Then** I see a loading indicator followed by an AI response
3. **Given** the AI responds, **When** I read the response, **Then** it is relevant to robotics and educational in tone
4. **Given** I receive a response, **When** I want to ask a follow-up, **Then** I can continue the conversation in the same thread

---

### User Story 2 - Expand Chat for Full Conversation (Priority: P2)

A student has multiple questions and wants to see the full conversation history. They expand the chat from the minimal input bar to a larger chat panel to review previous messages and continue the discussion.

**Why this priority**: Enables deeper engagement beyond single Q&A. Important for complex topics requiring back-and-forth dialogue.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking 2-3 questions, expanding the chat panel, and verifying all messages are visible and scrollable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an ongoing conversation, **When** I click to expand the chat, **Then** a larger panel opens showing full conversation history
2. **Given** the chat panel is expanded, **When** I scroll, **Then** I can see all previous messages in order
3. **Given** the chat panel is expanded, **When** I click to minimize, **Then** it returns to the compact input bar

---

### User Story 3 - Get Context-Aware Help (Priority: P3)

The AI tutor is aware of which lesson the student is currently reading and can provide answers that reference the current topic, suggest related lessons, or explain how concepts connect to the broader curriculum.

**Why this priority**: Enhances learning by connecting questions to the curriculum structure. Valuable but not essential for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking "What am I learning about?" on different lesson pages and verifying the AI correctly identifies the current topic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the "Embodiment Hypothesis" lesson, **When** I ask "What is this lesson about?", **Then** the AI responds with accurate information about embodiment in robotics
2. **Given** I ask about a concept from a different lesson, **When** the AI responds, **Then** it may suggest I visit the relevant lesson for more details

### User Story 4 - Text Selection Actions (Priority: P2)

A student is reading a lesson and encounters a technical term or complex paragraph they want to understand better. They highlight the text, and a floating tooltip appears with three options: "Explain", "Translate", and "Summarize". Clicking any option automatically opens the chat and sends the selected text with the chosen action.

**Why this priority**: Enables seamless interaction without manual copy-paste. Critical for engagement and learning flow. Same priority as US2 since both enhance core chat experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by highlighting any text on a lesson page, verifying tooltip appears with 3 buttons, clicking "Explain", and verifying chat opens with the selected text and receives an explanation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any lesson page, **When** I highlight text (select with mouse or touch), **Then** a floating tooltip appears near the selection with "Explain", "Translate", "Summarize" buttons
2. **Given** the tooltip is visible, **When** I click "Explain", **Then** the chat opens/expands and shows "Explain: [selected text]" as my message
3. **Given** the tooltip is visible, **When** I click "Translate", **Then** the chat opens and shows "Translate to Urdu: [selected text]" as my message
4. **Given** the tooltip is visible, **When** I click "Summarize", **Then** the chat opens and shows "Summarize: [selected text]" as my message
5. **Given** I sent a selection action, **When** the AI responds, **Then** it performs the requested action (explanation, translation, or summary) on the selected text
6. **Given** the tooltip is visible, **When** I click elsewhere or clear selection, **Then** the tooltip disappears

### User Story 5 - Anonymous User Trial with Message Limit (Priority: P1)

An anonymous visitor discovers the AI tutor and starts asking questions. They can use the chat for up to 10 messages to try the feature. After reaching the limit, they are prompted to sign in to continue. If they sign in, their previous conversation is migrated to persistent storage so they don't lose their chat history.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user acquisition funnel - allows trying before committing while encouraging sign-ups. Prevents abuse of anonymous access while providing value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending 10 messages as anonymous user, verifying limit prompt appears, signing in, and verifying previous messages are preserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an anonymous user, **When** I send my first message, **Then** the chat works normally with no persistence warnings
2. **Given** I am an anonymous user with 7 messages sent, **When** I view the chat, **Then** I see a warning "3 messages remaining. Sign in to save your chat."
3. **Given** I am an anonymous user with 10 messages sent, **When** I try to send another message, **Then** I see a prompt to sign in with message "Message limit reached. Sign in to continue chatting and save your conversation."
4. **Given** I am blocked by the message limit, **When** I click the sign in button, **Then** I am redirected to the authentication flow
5. **Given** I had messages as an anonymous user, **When** I complete sign in, **Then** my previous messages are migrated to a new persistent thread
6. **Given** I signed in after anonymous usage, **When** I view my chat history, **Then** I see all my previous anonymous messages preserved

### User Story 6 - Persistent Conversations for Authenticated Users (Priority: P2)

An authenticated user wants their conversation history saved so they can continue where they left off. When they return to the site, their previous conversations are available and they can switch between threads.

**Why this priority**: Essential for engaged users who want to reference past interactions. Builds on US5 by providing the value proposition for signing in.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by signing in, having a conversation, refreshing the page, and verifying the conversation persists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I send a message, **Then** it is automatically saved to my account
2. **Given** I am signed in with existing threads, **When** I return to the site, **Then** my most recent conversation is restored
3. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I click "New Chat", **Then** a new thread is created and I can start fresh
4. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I view thread history, **Then** I see a list of my previous conversations with titles
5. **Given** I am viewing thread history, **When** I click a previous thread, **Then** that conversation is loaded into the chat

---

### User Story 7 - Thread Management (Priority: P3)

An authenticated user wants to manage their conversation history by renaming threads for easier identification or deleting old conversations they no longer need.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have for power users who have many conversations. Not critical for core experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple threads, renaming one, deleting another, and verifying changes persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing my thread list, **When** I click rename on a thread, **Then** I can edit the title inline
2. **Given** I renamed a thread, **When** I save the new title, **Then** the change persists across sessions
3. **Given** I am viewing my thread list, **When** I click delete on a thread, **Then** I see a confirmation prompt
4. **Given** I confirmed thread deletion, **When** the action completes, **Then** the thread is removed from my history

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the backend service is unavailable? → Display friendly error message and suggest trying again
- How does the system handle very long messages? → Truncate input at 2000 characters with visible counter
- What happens when multiple messages are sent rapidly? → Queue messages and process in order, show pending indicator
- How does the chat handle non-robotics questions? → AI politely redirects to robotics topics while remaining helpful
- What happens on mobile devices with limited screen space? → Chat bar remains at bottom, panel uses full-screen overlay when expanded
- What happens when user selects very long text? → Truncate to 500 characters with "[...truncated]" indicator
- What happens when user selects text inside code blocks? → Tooltip still appears, works the same way
- What happens when tooltip would appear off-screen? → Position tooltip to stay within viewport bounds
- What happens on touch devices? → Show tooltip on long-press selection completion

### Key Entities

- **Message**: A single chat message with content, sender (user/assistant), timestamp, and status (pending/sent/error)
- **Conversation**: A collection of messages in chronological order, associated with a browser session
- **AI Provider**: Configuration for which AI service to use (OpenAI or Gemini), switchable via environment variable
- **SelectionAction**: An action triggered by text selection with type (explain/translate/summarize), selected text, and source location

## Assumptions

1. **No persistence required**: Conversations are session-based and cleared on page refresh. Persistent history is out of scope for hackathon.
2. **Single AI agent**: One general-purpose robotics tutor agent handles all questions. Specialized agents (per topic) are out of scope.
3. **No file uploads**: Users cannot upload images or files to the chat. Text-only interaction.
4. **No authentication**: Anyone visiting the site can use the chat. Rate limiting may be added later but is not required for hackathon.
5. **English only**: AI responses are in English. Multi-language support is out of scope.
6. **Desktop-first**: Mobile support should work but is not the primary design target for hackathon.

## Out of Scope

- User accounts and authentication
- Persistent conversation history across sessions
- File/image uploads
- Voice input/output
- Multi-language support
- Analytics and usage tracking
- Rate limiting
- Custom AI personalities or avatars
