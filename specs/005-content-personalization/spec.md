# Feature Specification: Content Personalization

**Feature Branch**: `005-content-personalization`
**Created**: 2025-11-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add content personalization with onboarding questionnaire and lesson adaptation based on user profile"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Onboarding Questionnaire (Priority: P1)

A first-time visitor to the textbook is prompted to complete an onboarding questionnaire to personalize their learning experience. They answer 6 questions about their education level, programming experience, robotics background, AI/ML experience, learning goals, and preferred language.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all personalization. Without user preferences stored, no personalization can occur. It establishes the user profile that drives all subsequent features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the site as a new user, completing the questionnaire, and verifying preferences are stored and retrievable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a first-time visitor with no stored user_id, **When** they visit any lesson page, **Then** they are redirected to the onboarding questionnaire
2. **Given** a user on the onboarding page, **When** they complete all 6 questions and submit, **Then** their preferences are saved and they are redirected to the home page
3. **Given** a user who has completed onboarding, **When** they return to the site, **Then** they are not prompted to complete onboarding again

---

### User Story 2 - View Personalized Lesson Content (Priority: P1)

A student who has completed onboarding visits a lesson page and sees two tabs: "Original" and "Personalized". When they click "Personalized", the system generates content adapted to their profile (education level, experience, preferred language).

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - delivering personalized educational content based on the user's background and preferences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing onboarding, navigating to a lesson, clicking "Personalized" tab, and verifying the content is adapted to the user's profile.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an onboarded user viewing a lesson, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see "Original" and "Personalized" tabs with "Original" selected by default
2. **Given** a user viewing the Original tab, **When** they click "Personalized", **Then** the system fetches personalized content based on their profile
3. **Given** a beginner programmer user, **When** they view personalized content, **Then** code explanations are expanded with simpler examples
4. **Given** a user with Urdu as preferred language, **When** they view personalized content, **Then** explanatory text is in Urdu while technical terms remain in English

---

### User Story 3 - Update Preferences (Priority: P2)

A returning user wants to update their learning preferences (e.g., they gained more programming experience or want to switch to a different language). They can access their profile settings and modify their preferences.

**Why this priority**: Users' knowledge and goals evolve over time. Allowing preference updates ensures continued relevance of personalized content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing profile settings, modifying preferences, and verifying personalized content reflects the changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an onboarded user, **When** they access profile settings, **Then** they see their current preferences pre-filled
2. **Given** a user editing preferences, **When** they update and save, **Then** their new preferences are persisted
3. **Given** a user who updated preferences, **When** they view personalized content, **Then** the content reflects their updated profile

---

### User Story 4 - Cached Personalization (Priority: P3)

For performance, personalized content is cached after first generation. When a user revisits a lesson they've already personalized, the cached version loads instantly instead of regenerating.

**Why this priority**: Performance optimization improves user experience but is not essential for MVP functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by personalizing a lesson, navigating away, returning, and verifying instant load from cache.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user requesting personalized content for the first time, **When** the content is generated, **Then** it is cached with a hash of the original content
2. **Given** a user revisiting a previously personalized lesson, **When** the original content hash matches, **Then** cached content is served immediately
3. **Given** a user who updated their preferences, **When** they revisit a previously personalized lesson, **Then** the cache is invalidated and new personalized content is generated

---

### User Story 5 - Browse Book Structure (Priority: P1)

A user can browse the complete book structure through an API that returns the hierarchical organization of Parts, Chapters, and Lessons. Content is stored in a cloud bucket and indexed in a vector database for RAG.

**Why this priority**: Book structure is foundational for progress tracking, recommendations, and RAG-based tutoring.

**Independent Test**: Call GET /api/content/book and verify complete hierarchy is returned with all parts, chapters, and lessons.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accessing the content API, **When** they request the book structure, **Then** they receive a complete hierarchy of parts → chapters → lessons
2. **Given** a lesson in the database, **When** the content is requested, **Then** the markdown is retrieved from the storage bucket
3. **Given** a lesson with embeddings, **When** a semantic search is performed, **Then** relevant lesson chunks are returned from the vector database

---

### User Story 6 - Track Learning Progress (Priority: P2)

A user's progress through the textbook is tracked automatically. When they start or complete a lesson, this is recorded and persisted. They can view their overall progress summary.

**Why this priority**: Progress tracking enables recommendations and helps users understand their learning journey.

**Independent Test**: Start a lesson → verify progress marked as "in_progress" → complete it → verify marked as "completed" → view progress summary.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user viewing a lesson, **When** they start reading, **Then** their progress is recorded as "in_progress"
2. **Given** a user who finished a lesson, **When** they mark it complete, **Then** their progress is recorded as "completed" with timestamp
3. **Given** a user with partial progress, **When** they request progress summary, **Then** they see completion percentages per part and chapter
4. **Given** a user tracking time, **When** they spend time on a lesson, **Then** time_spent_seconds is accumulated

---

### User Story 7 - Get Personalized Recommendations (Priority: P2)

Based on a user's preferences, completed lessons, and current progress, the system recommends the next lessons to study. Recommendations consider prerequisites and learning goals.

**Why this priority**: Smart recommendations improve learning outcomes by guiding users through optimal paths.

**Independent Test**: Complete some lessons → request recommendations → verify suggested lessons match user's goals and respect prerequisites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with completed lessons, **When** they request recommendations, **Then** they receive next sequential lessons in incomplete chapters
2. **Given** a user with specific learning goals, **When** recommendations are generated, **Then** lessons aligned with those goals are prioritized
3. **Given** a lesson with prerequisites, **When** a user hasn't completed prerequisites, **Then** that lesson is not recommended
4. **Given** a beginner user, **When** recommendations are generated, **Then** L1/L2 layer lessons are prioritized over advanced layers

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user clears localStorage? They are treated as a new user and prompted to complete onboarding again.
- What happens if personalization request fails? Display error message and allow retry, with Original content still accessible.
- What happens with very long lesson content? Personalization request includes pagination or chunking to handle large content.
- What happens if user skips onboarding? They can still view Original content; Personalized tab shows prompt to complete onboarding.
- What happens if the backend is unavailable? Original content remains accessible; Personalized tab shows connection error.
