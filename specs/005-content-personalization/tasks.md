# Tasks: Content Personalization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-content-personalization/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.yaml, quickstart.md

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `packages/chatkit-backend/src/chatkit_backend/`
- **Frontend**: `apps/docs/src/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 are both P1 priority but have no dependencies on each other
  - US3 (P2) can proceed after Foundational, integrates with US1/US2
  - US4 (P3) enhances US2 but can be developed in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Book Structure (Phase 8)**: Depends on Phase 2 Foundational
- **Storage Integration (Phase 9)**: Depends on Phase 8 Book Structure
- **Vector DB (Phase 10)**: Depends on Phase 8, can run in parallel with Phase 9
- **Progress Tracking (Phase 11)**: Depends on Phase 8 Book Structure
- **Recommendations (Phase 12)**: Depends on Phase 11 Progress Tracking
- **Integration Testing (Phase 13)**: Depends on Phases 9, 10, 11, 12

### User Story Dependencies

    US5 --> US6[User Story 6: Progress]
    US6 --> US7[User Story 7: Recommendations]
```

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Foundation for user management
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses User model, independent of onboarding flow
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Benefits from US1 (needs preferences to exist) but can be developed after Foundation
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Enhances US2 (adds caching layer) but can be developed after Foundation
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Book Structure - Creates tables, storage sync, vector embeddings
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Progress Tracking - Depends on US5 (needs lessons table)
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Recommendations - Depends on US6 (needs progress data)

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services/endpoints
- Backend endpoints before frontend components
- Core implementation before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks T011, T012, T013 can run in parallel
- US1 tasks T015, T017, T022 can run in parallel (different files)
- US2 tasks T025, T027, T031, T032 can run in parallel (different files)
- US3 task T038 can run in parallel with backend tasks

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch these in parallel (different files):
Task: "Create UserPreferences model in packages/chatkit-backend/src/chatkit_backend/db/models.py"
Task: "Create Pydantic schemas for user and onboarding in packages/chatkit-backend/src/chatkit_backend/models/user.py"
Task: "Create OnboardingQuestionnaire component (6 questions) in apps/docs/src/components/OnboardingQuestionnaire.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch these in parallel (different files):
Task: "Create PersonalizedContentCache model in packages/chatkit-backend/src/chatkit_backend/db/models.py"
Task: "Create Pydantic schemas for personalization in packages/chatkit-backend/src/chatkit_backend/models/personalize.py"
Task: "Create PersonalizedLesson component with tabs in apps/docs/src/components/PersonalizedLesson/index.tsx"
Task: "Create PersonalizedContent component with fetch logic in apps/docs/src/components/PersonalizedLesson/PersonalizedContent.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test onboarding flow independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can complete onboarding!

### MVP+ (User Stories 1 & 2)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational
2. Complete User Story 1 → Test independently
3. Complete User Story 2 → Test independently
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: New users can onboard AND view personalized content
5. This is a strong MVP demonstrating core value proposition

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP+ (US1 + US2) → Deploy
2. Add User Story 3 → Users can update preferences → Deploy
3. Add User Story 4 → Performance optimization → Deploy
4. Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (onboarding)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (personalization UI)
3. After US1 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (update preferences)
4. After US2 complete:
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (caching)
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Backend tasks should be completed before corresponding frontend tasks within each story
- MCP servers (storage:8001, vectordal:8002) must be running for Phases 9-10
- Seed data from `.specify/memory/curriculum.md` for Phase 8
