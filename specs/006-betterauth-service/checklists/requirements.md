## Functional Requirements Validation

### Service Architecture (FR-001)
- [x] FR-001: Standalone auth service at port 3001

### User Management (FR-002 to FR-004)
- [x] FR-002: Account creation with email, name, password
- [x] FR-003: Password validation (8+ characters)
- [x] FR-004: Sign in with email/password

### Session Management (FR-005 to FR-006)
- [x] FR-005: 7-day session with automatic refresh
- [x] FR-006: Session sharing across services (3001, 3000, 8000)

### Data Storage (FR-007)
- [x] FR-007: Separate NeonDB with Drizzle ORM

### Integration (FR-008 to FR-011)
- [x] FR-008: Session validation endpoints for FastAPI
- [x] FR-009: CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- [x] FR-010: User-friendly error messages
- [x] FR-011: Sign out terminates session across all services

### Implementation Approach (FR-012)
- [x] FR-012: Reuse patterns from reference SSO implementation

## Non-Functional Requirements Validation

- [x] NFR-001: Response time < 2 seconds
- [x] NFR-002: Secure password hashing (no plaintext)
- [x] NFR-003: HTTPS-only cookies in production
- [x] NFR-004: No sensitive error details exposed

## Key Entities Validation
- [x] User entity defined (id, email, name, emailVerified, image, timestamps)
- [x] Session entity defined (id, token, expiration, IP, user agent, userId)
- [x] Account entity defined (provider, password hash, userId)
- [x] Verification entity defined (for future use)

## Success Criteria Validation
- [x] SC-001: Sign-up in < 1 minute (measurable)
- [x] SC-002: Sign-in in < 30 seconds (measurable)
- [x] SC-003: Session valid for 7 days (measurable)
- [x] SC-004: Docs site identifies auth users (measurable)
- [x] SC-005: FastAPI validates 100% of protected requests (measurable)
- [x] SC-006: Zero plaintext passwords (verifiable)
- [x] SC-007: CORS blocks unauthorized origins (verifiable)

## Edge Cases Validation
- [x] Unauthenticated docs browsing allowed
- [x] Auth service unavailable graceful degradation
- [x] Password compromise (deferred to future)
- [x] Network interruption during sign-up

## Quality Checks
- [x] No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain
- [x] All requirements are testable
- [x] Requirements are technology-agnostic (what, not how)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] User stories are independently testable
- [x] Reference implementation clearly documented
- [x] Out of scope items explicitly listed

- **Total Functional Requirements**: 12
- **Total Non-Functional Requirements**: 4
- **Total Success Criteria**: 7
- **Total User Stories**: 4
- **Edge Cases Documented**: 4
- **Validation Status**: PASSED
